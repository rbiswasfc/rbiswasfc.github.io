      <description>&amp;ndash; Project Status: Active Objective To develop a web based platform that gives personalized recommendations for travel destinations and activities based on user preferences. The recommendations will be accompanied with a list of directly comparable features pertaining to the suggested destinations, such that the user(s) can delve deeper and emerge with a satisfied choice.
To this end, a bottom-up solution algorithm is adopted:
 At the top level, a list of countries are considered Each country contains a list of travel destinations Each destination contains a list of Points Of Interest (POI)  We will predict the scores of the POIs based on user profile.</description>

      <description>Shopee, an e-commerce platform headquartered in Singapore, organized the National Data Science Challenge during February-March 2019, highlighting Singaporeâ€™s emphasis on driving the digital economy and the use of big data. I actively participated in this competition to apply machine learning skills for a real world commercial application. It was an enriching experience, with a bonus that my team (NYRS) secured the third position in the competition leaderboard. This article summarizes steps followed to solve the problem.</description>
