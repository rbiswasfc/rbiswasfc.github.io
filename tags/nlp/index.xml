      <title>Neural Machine Translation using Encoder-Decoder Networks</title>

      <description>&amp;ndash; Project Status: Active In this project, I aim at building different sequence to sequence machine learning models for Spanish to English translation task using PyTorch. The Sequence to sequence or &amp;ldquo;Seq2Seq&amp;rdquo; is an end-to-end model comprising of two recurrent neural networks:
 An Encoder: takes sentences in the source language as input and encodes them into finite dimensional context vectors;
 A Decoder: uses the context vector as a seed from which the translated sentences are generated.</description>

      <description>Shopee, an e-commerce platform headquartered in Singapore, organized the National Data Science Challenge during February-March 2019, highlighting Singaporeâ€™s emphasis on driving the digital economy and the use of big data. I actively participated in this competition to apply machine learning skills for a real world commercial application. It was an enriching experience, with a bonus that my team (NYRS) secured the third position in the competition leaderboard. This article summarizes steps followed to solve the problem.</description>
